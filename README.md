## 📋 Description
This project focuses on analyzing movie datasets and user ratings to explore user preferences and enhance recommendation systems. It involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means).
- Evaluation metrics such as silhouette scores for clustering performance.
- A basis for personalized movie recommendations.

## 📂 Files
- `movies.csv`: Dataset containing movie information (e.g., title, genres).
- `ratings.csv`: Dataset with user ratings for movies.
- `main.ipynb`: The core notebook containing the entire analysis and implementation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## ⚙️ How to Run
